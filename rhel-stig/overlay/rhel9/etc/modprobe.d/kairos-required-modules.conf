# STIG Exception: Required filesystem modules for Kairos immutable OS boot
# These modules are required to mount the base squashfs image and overlayfs root
# Without these modules, the system cannot boot
# 
# This file ensures these modules are explicitly allowed and not blacklisted
# by STIG remediation rules that might restrict module loading

# Allow squashfs - required to mount the base immutable root filesystem image
allow squashfs

# Allow overlay - required for overlayfs root filesystem
allow overlay

# Allow loop - required to mount squashfs images via loop devices
allow loop

# Note: If STIG requires module restrictions, these modules should be
# explicitly allowlisted rather than globally disabled
