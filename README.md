# CanvOS

CanvOS is designed to leverage the Spectro Cloud Edge Forge architecture to build edge artifacts. These artifacts can then be used by Palette for building edge clusters with little to no touch by end users.

With CanvOS, we leverage Earthly to build all of the artifacts required for edge deployments. From the installer iso to the Kubernetes Provider images, CanvOS makes it simple for you to build the images customized to your needs.

The base image definitions reside in the Earthfile located in this repo. This defines all of the elements that are required for building the artifacts that can be used by Palette for edge deployments. If customized packages need to be added, simply add the reference to the Dockerfile as you would for any Docker image. When the build command is run, the Earthfile will merge those custom packages into the final image. For a quickstart tutorial see the Knowledgebase section of the Spectro Cloud Docs. There you will find a quickstart tutorial for building your first CanvOS artifacts.

## Image Build Architecture

### Base Image

From the Kairos project, this is derived from the operating system distribution chosen (currently Ubuntu and OpenSuse-Leap supported). It is pulled down as the base image and some adjustments are made to better support Palette. Those adjustments are used to clean and update the image as well as install some required packages.

### Provider Image

From the Base Image, the provider image is used to package in the Kubernetes distribution and version(s) that are part of the build. This layer is required to initialize the system and prepare it for configuration to build the Kubernetes cluster.

### Installer Image

From the base image, this image is used to provide the initial flashing of a device (bare-metal or virtual machine). This image contains the user-data configuration that has been provided in `user-data`. It will also contain the contents of any content bundle for pre-staged builds. Pre-staged builds can be used to embed all of the artifacts that are required to build a cluster. These artifacts include Helm charts, manifests, and container images. These images are loaded into containerd when the cluster is initialized eliminating the need for the initial download. For more information on how to build pre-loaded content checkout the Palette Docs at [Build your Own Content](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/build-content-bundle).

### Custom Configuration

For advanced use cases, there may be a need to add additional packages not included in the [Base Images](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/master/images). If those packages or configuration elements need to be added, they can be included in the empty `Dockerfile` located in this repo and they will be included in the build process and output artifacts.

### Basic Usage

1. Clone the repo at [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git)

Note: If you are building the images behind a proxy server, you may need to configure your git to let it use your proxy server.

```
git config --global http.proxy <your-proxy-server>
git config --global https.proxy <your-proxy-server>
git config --global http.sslCAinfo <your-cert-path>
git config --global https.sslCAinfo <your-cert-path>
# git config --global http.sslVerify False
# git config --global https.sslVerify False
```

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
```

**Sample Output**

```shell
Cloning into 'CanvOS'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 133, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (133/133), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (88/88), done.
Receiving objects: 100% (133/133), 40.16 KiB | 5.02 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (60/60), done.
remote: Total 133 (delta 60), reused 101 (delta 32), pack-reused 0
```

2. Change into the `CanvOS` directory that was created.

```shell
cd CanvOS
```

3. View Available tags

```shell
git tag

v3.3.3
v3.4.0
v3.4.1
v3.4.3

v4.1.0
v4.2.3

v4.5.11
```

4. Checkout the desired tag

> **Note:** If you have a dedicated or on-prem instance of Palette, identify the correct agent version and checkout the corresponding tag. For example, if your agent version is v4.6.16, checkout tag v4.6.16.
>
> ```shell
> curl --location --request GET 'https://<palette-endpoint>/v1/services/stylus/version' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Apikey: <api-key>'  | jq --raw-output '.spec.latestVersion.content | match("version: ([^\n]+)").captures[0].string'
> # Sample Output
> v4.6.16
> 
> ```

```shell
git checkout <tag version>
```

**Sample Output**

```shell
git checkout v4.2.3
Note: switching to 'v4.2.3'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
```

1. Copy the .arg.template file to .arg

```shell
cp .arg.template .arg
```

6. To build RHEL core, RHEL FIPS or Ubuntu fips, sles base images switch to respective directories and build the base image.
   The base image built can be passed as argument to build the installer and provider images.
   Follow the instructions in the respective sub-folders (rhel-fips, ubuntu-fips) to create base images.
   For ubuntu-fips, this image can be used as base image - `gcr.io/spectro-images-public/ubuntu-fips:v3.0.11`
   Skip this step if your base image is ubuntu or opensuse-leap. If you are building ubuntu or opensuse-leap installer images, do not pass the BASE_IMAGE attribute as an arg to build command.

7. Modify the `.arg` file as needed. Primarily, you must define the tag you want to use for your images. For example, if the operating system is `ubuntu` and the tag is `demo`, the image artefact will name as `ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-demo`. The **.arg** file defines the following variables:

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Type    | Default Value              |

>For use cases where UEFI installers are burned into a USB and then edge hosts are booted with the USB. Use the OSBUILDER_VERSION=0.300.4 in the .arg file with canvos when building the installer.
Version 0.300.3 does not support UEFI builds loading from USB.

> If there are certs to be added, place them in the `certs` folder.

1. (Optional) If you are building the images behind a proxy server, you may need to modify your docker daemon settings to let it use your proxy server. You can refer this [tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy).

2. Build the images with the following command. Use the `system.uri` output when creating the cluster profile for the Edge host.

```shell
./earthly.sh +build-all-images --ARCH=amd64
```

To build FIPS complaint images or ARM images, specify the BASE_IMAGE and ARCH in the .arg file or as command line arguments.
`k3s` does not FIPS and rke2 is by default `FIPS` compliant.

To build just the installer image

```shell
./earthly.sh +iso --ARCH=amd64
```

To build the provider images

```shell
./earthly.sh +build-provider-images --ARCH=amd64
```

To build the fips enabled ubuntu installer image

```shell
./earthly.sh +iso --BASE_IMAGE=gcr.io/spectro-images-public/ubuntu-fips:v3.0.11 --FIPS_ENABLED=true --ARCH=amd64 --PE_VERSION=v4.4.0
```

Output

```shell

10. Validate the expected artifacts are created, the ISO image and the provider OS images.

```shell
ls build/ && docker images

Earthly is a multi-architecture build tool. In this example we are building images for AMD64 hardware which is reflected by the tags above. In the future we will support ARM64 builds and those tags will be included. We only need to push the image tag that DOES NOT have the architecture reference i.e `linux_amd64` in the above example.

11. The provider images are by default not pushed to a registry. You can push the images by using the `docker push` command and reference the created images.

```shell
docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.25.2-v4.2.3-demo
```

> ⚠️ The default registry, [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) is a short-lived registry. Images in the ttl.sh registry have a default time to live of
> 24 hours. Once the time limit is up, the images will automatically be removed. To use a permanent registry, set the `.arg` file's `IMAGE_REGISTRY` parameter with the URL of your image registry.

12. Create a cluster profile using the command output. Use the [Model Edge Cluster Profile](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/site-deployment/model-profile) to help you complete this step.

13. Flash VM or Baremetal device with the generated ISO. Refer to the [Prepare Edge Host for Installation](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/site-deployment/stage) guide for additional guidance.

14. Register the Edge host with Palette. Checkout the [Register Edge Host](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/edge-host-registration) guide.

15. Build a cluster in [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

### How-Tos

- [Building Edge Native Artifacts](<[https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos](https://deploy-preview-1318--docs-spectrocloud.netlify.app/clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos)>)

### Building ARM64 Artifacts for Nvidia Jetson devices

1. Your .arg file should contain these values

```shell
BASE_IMAGE=quay.io/kairos/ubuntu:20.04-core-arm64-nvidia-jetson-agx-orin-v2.4.3
ARCH=arm64
platform=linux/arm64
```

2. `./earthly.sh +build-all-images`

### Prepare keys for Trusted Boot

1. In .arg, we have these options to configure the key generation for Trusted Boot.

```
UKI_BRING_YOUR_OWN_KEYS=false # set to true if you want to to use your own public/private key pairs to generate SecureBoot keys
INCLUDE_MS_SECUREBOOT_KEYS=true # if you want to include Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA certificate in generated keys
```

2. Copy required keys into secure-boot directory. It should look like this:

```shell
secure-boot/
|   enrollment
|   exported-keys <-- keys exported from hardware
|   |   db
|   |   KEK
|   private-keys <-- Will be used if UKI_BRING_YOUR_OWN_KEYS=true, otherwise CanvOS will generate the keys
|   |   db.key
|   |   KEK.key
|   |   PK.key
|   |   tpm2-pcr-private.pem
|   public-keys <-- Will be used if UKI_BRING_YOUR_OWN_KEYS=true, otherwise CanvOS will generate the keys
|   |   db.pem
|   |   KEK.pem
|   |   PK.pem
```

Optionally, you can add additional public keys to be added to the KEK and/or db database, by placing them in the following directories:
```shell
secure-boot/
|   extra-KEK-keys <-- extra KEK keys to include, can be any filename, supports PEM and DER certificates
|   |   key1.pem
|   |   key2.pem
|   |   ...
|   extra-db-keys <-- extra db keys to include, can be any filename, supports PEM and DER certificates
|   |   key1.pem
|   |   key2.pem
|   |   ...
```

3. Generate keys for Trusted Boot

```shell
./earthly.sh +uki-genkey --MY_ORG="ACME Corp" --EXPIRATION_IN_DAYS=5475
```

### Build Trusted Boot Images

1. Your .arg file should contain these values.

```shell
IS_UKI=true
AUTO_ENROLL_SECUREBOOT_KEYS=false # Auto enroll SecureBoot keys when device boots up and is in setup mode of secure boot
```

2. `./earthly.sh +build-all-images`

### Building with private registry

1. Make sure you have logged into your registry using docker login
2. In .arg, add following entries

```shell
SPECTRO_LUET_REPO=reg.xxx.com
SPECTRO_PUB_REPO=reg.xxx.com
KAIROS_BASE_IMAGE_URL=reg.xxx.com
```

3. Make sure you have following images and your base image retagged to your repo

```shell
gcr.io/spectro-images-public/earthly/earthly:v0.8.5 to reg.xxx.com/earthly/earthly:v0.8.5
gcr.io/spectro-images-public/earthly/buildkitd:v0.8.5 to reg.xxx.com/earthly/buildkitd:v0.8.5
gcr.io/spectro-images-public/canvos/alpine-cert:v1.0.0 to reg.xxx.com/canvos/alpine-cert:v1.0.0
gcr.io/spectro-images-public/osbuilder-tools:v0.7.11 to reg.xxx.com/osbuilder-tools:v0.7.11
gcr.io/spectro-images-public/stylus-framework-linux-amd64:v4.3.2 to reg.xxx.com/stylus-framework-linux-amd64:v4.3.2
gcr.io/spectro-images-public/kairos-io/provider-kubeadm:v4.3.1 to reg.xxx.com/kairos-io/provider-kubeadm:v4.3.1
gcr.io/spectro-images-public/kairos-io/provider-k3s:v4.2.1 to reg.xxx.com/kairos-io/provider-k3s:v4.2.1
gcr.io/spectro-images-public/kairos-io/provider-rke2:v4.1.1 to reg.xxx.com/kairos-io/provider-rke2:v4.1.1
```

4. Prepare luet auth config

```shell
cp spectro-luet-auth.yaml.template spectro-luet-auth.yaml
# modify serveraddess, username and password in spectro-luet-auth.yaml to yours
```

5. Build the image using earthly installed on the host

```shell
earthly --push +build-all-images
```

### Building Installer Image with public key for verifying signed content

1. Copy the .edge.custom-config.yaml.template file to .edge.custom-config.yaml

```shell
cp .edge.custom-config.yaml.template .edge.custom-config.yaml
```

2. Edit the property signing.publicKey in `.edge.custom-config.yaml`

3. Include the following property in `.arg` file

```
...

EDGE_CUSTOM_CONFIG=/path/to/.edge.custom-config.yaml
```

4. Build the image using earthly installed on the host

```shell
earthly --push +build-all-images
```

### Audit Logs User Customisation

#### Configuration

rsyslog config file: `overlay/files/etc/rsyslog.d/49-stylus.conf` copied to `/etc/rsyslog.d/49-stylus.conf`  
logrotate config file: `overlay/files/etc/logrotate.d/stylus.conf` copied to `/etc/logrotate.d/stylus.conf`

#### Send stylus audit events to user file

Users can log stylus audit events to additional files, in addition to `/var/log/stylus-audit.log`. To log stylus audit events to custom files, create a configuration file in the `overlay/files/etc/rsyslog.d` directory named `<filename>.conf` (must be before `49-stylus.conf` lexicographically).

Example: `48-audit.conf`

Users can use the following configuration as a base for their filtering logic. replace `<log file name>` with the desired file name

```
$PrivDropToUser root
$PrivDropToGroup root
if ($syslogfacility-text == 'local7' and $syslogseverity-text == 'notice' and $syslogtag contains 'stylus-audit') then {
    action(
        type="omfile"
        file="<log file name>"
    )
}
```

#### Send user application audit events to stylus audit file

To include user application audit events in the `/var/log/stylus-audit.log` file, add the following to the same configuration file (e.g. `48-audit.conf`) or create a new config file before `49-stylus.conf`:

`<user app name>` : user application name or tag

```
$PrivDropToUser root
$PrivDropToGroup root
$Umask 0000
$template ForwardFormat,"<%pri%>1 %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag% %procid% - - %msg%\n"
if ($syslogfacility-text == 'local7' and $syslogseverity-text == 'notice' and $syslogtag contains '<user app name>') then {
    action(
        type="omfile"
        file="/var/log/stylus-audit.log"
        FileCreateMode="0600"
        fileowner="root"
        template="ForwardFormat"
    )
}
```

To display user audit entries on the Local UI dashboard, audit entries must be logged in RFC 5424 format with the message (`msg`) part in JSON format. This JSON message must include the following keys: `edgeHostId`, `contentMsg`, `action`, `actor`, `actorType`, `resourceId`, `resourceName`, `resourceKind`

Example syslog entry

```
<189>1 2024-07-23T15:35:32.644461+00:00 edge-ce0a38422e4662887313fb673bbfb2a2 stylus-audit[2911]: 2911 - - {"edgeHostId":"edge-ce0a38422e4662887313fb6 73bbfb2a2","contentMsg":"kairos password reset failed","action":"activity","actor":"kairos","actorType":"user","resourceId":"kairos","resourceName":"kairos","resourceKind":"user"}
```

Entries without these keys in the MSG part of RFC 5424 will still be logged to the stylus-audit.log file but will not be displayed on LocalUI.
